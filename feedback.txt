Feedback
--------
DESIGN:
Your initial design was vague in regards to accidentals. Everything else was good, however, and you addressed this shortcoming in your final design.

CODE READABILITY:
Your package hierarchy is fine. Your code is readable, but comments are lacking in some places: notably, Lexer.java. While commenting code can be time-consuming and difficult, especially under pressure, doing so is an excellent habit to form: a habit that will greatly increase your overall productivity. It is excellent that you added comments to your test files, however.

SPECS:
Your specs were always present, albeit brief at times. Good job!

FUNCTIONALITY:
You were able to play scale.abc with no problems. You played little_night_music.abc with problems, but the tune was unmistakable. You played paddy.abc with few, if any, problems. Your playback of invention.abc had readily apparent problems: sections of the song were playing out of order. prelude.abc had the same problem, as did fur_elise.abc.

Due to these problems, many of the staff unit tests had problems in playback.

TESTING:
Excellent testing strategy. I would have liked to see more automated end-to-end tests, however.

OVERALL:
Congratulations on completing a difficult project! Hopefully, this was an excellent learning experience -- working with groups on an open-ended programming task can be daunting for anyone. Have some lunch or dessert (e.g. fro-yo) as a team to celebrate a project complete!
